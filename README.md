Your friendly neighborhood S3 _and Swift_ helper. It knows just a few tricks, but
hopefully they'll help you out.

- __Automatic retries__ -- with exponential backoff to make your life easier
- __Parallel batch operations__ -- using __gevent__ to make it hella fast
- __Built-in Mocking__ -- to make your testing easier
- __Automatic multipart uploading__ -- and it can retry each piece individually
- Support for `swift` and `s3`

Installation
------------

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

Backend
-------
Select a backend explicitly when creating a connection:

```python
import s3po

# Provide arguments that would normally be provided to `python-swiftclient`, like:
#
#   `authurl`, `user`, `key`
#
conn = s3po.Connection.swift(...)

# Provide arguments that would normally be provided to `boto`, like:
#
#   `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, etc.
#
conn = s3po.Connection.s3(...)
```

Basic Use
=========
`s3po` knows a few tricks, but at its core, you'll use two methods: `upload`
and `download`:

```python
import s3po
conn = s3po.Connection.s3()

# Upload with a string
conn.upload('bucket', 'key', 'howdy')
# Upload a file
with open('foo.txt') as fin:
    conn.upload('bucket', 'key', fin)

# Download as a string
print conn.download('bucket', 'key')
# Or into a file
with open('foo.txt', 'w') as fout:
    conn.download('bucket', 'key', fout)
```

Batch Use
=========
The batch object works like a context manager that provide the same interface
as the connection object. The only difference is that all the requests run in
a `gevent` pool. When the context is closed, it waits for all functions to
finish.

```python
# Upload these in a gevent pool
keys = ['key.%i' for key in range(1000)]
with conn.batch(50) as batch:
    for key in keys:
        batch.upload('bucket', key, 'hello')

# And now they're all uploaded
```

Callbacks
---------
When you want to take some action with the result, all the functions have an
additional `callback` optional parameter to you can grab the result. This is
particularly useful when doing bulk downloads:

```python
from functools import partial

def func(key, value):
    print 'Downloaded %s from %s' % (key, value)

with conn.batch(50) as batch:
    for key in keys:
        batch.download('bucket', key, callback=partial(func, key))
```

Multipart
=========
If the provided data is sufficiently large, it will automatically run the upload
as a multipart upload rather than a single upload. The advantage here is that
for any part upload that fails, it will retry just that part.

Mocking
=======
You can turn on mocking to get the same functionality of `s3po` that you'd
expect but without ever having to touch S3. Use it as a context manager:

```python
# This doesn't touch S3 or Swift at all
with conn.mock():
    conn.upload('foo', 'bar', 'hello')
```

If you're writing tests, this is a common pattern:

```python
class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.s3po = ... # some existing s3po object in the library we're testing
        self.mock = self.s3po.mock()
        self.mock.start()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.mock.stop()
```

Development
===========
A `Vagrantfile` is provided for development:

```bash
# On the host OS
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

# On the vagrant instance
make test
make test3 # To run the tests under Python 3
```
